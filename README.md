Section 1 Overview of Gardening Water Dispenser

## A. What is Gardening Water Dispenser about?
The garden automatic watering tool, it activates whenever the soil moisture goes below the specific value and captures a picture at the same time prior to the environment.  Garden watering tool is for those who are keen on saving money and time. It is designed to ease the burdens of watering plants on a daily basis,  adjustment of the dripping volume at a given time which means the plants won’t be taking in insufficiently or excessively.

### Section 2 Hardware requirements 

#### Hardware checklist

Here are the hardware needed and what they are used for.



#### DHTT sensor
a) This DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor features a calibrated digital signal output with the temperature and humidity sensor capability. This sensor includes a resistive element and a sensor for wet NTC temperature measuring devices. In this project, DHTT sensor

#### Light Dependant Resistor (LDR)
b)The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity, in other words, it detects the amount of light value. In this project, the LDR plays a part in detecting the current light values.

#### MCP3008 ADC
c) With MCP3008 you can read quite a few analog signals from the Pi.  This chip is a great option if you just need to read simple analog signals, like from a temperature or light sensor. This part plays a big role in reading values taken from the LDR/sensors.

#### Resistor (6 x 330 Ω Resistors, 3 x 10K Ω Resistor)
d)Resistor helps to ensure the flow tothe rasp berry pi is smooth and not be damaged.
